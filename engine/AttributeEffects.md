# Attribute Effects in Enhanced Play Simulation

This document explains how each player, staff, and referee attribute directly impacts play outcomes in the enhanced play simulation engine.

## Overview

The Enhanced Play Simulator (`play_simulator_enhanced.dart`) uses granular, attribute-based calculations instead of generic `overallRating` values. Every play outcome is determined by the specific attributes of the players, coaches, and referees involved in the situation.

## Player Attributes by Position

### Quarterback (QB)
Position attributes: `Pass Strength`, `Accuracy`, `Evasion`

#### Pass Strength
- **Effect**: Determines QB's ability to throw deep passes and overcome distance penalties

  - Field goal holder accuracy (indirectly affects special teams)
- **Range**: 0-100, where 50 is average
- **Impact**: Higher values enable more accurate long throws and better performance under pressure

#### Accuracy  
- **Effect**: Primary factor in pass completion probability

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Pass Play
```
QB (Accuracy: 75) throws to WR (Catching: 80, Speed: 70)
Defender: CB (Coverage: 60, Speed: 65)

Base completion: 40%
QB accuracy bonus: (75-50)/100 = +25%
WR catching bonus: (80-50)/150 = +20%
Defender coverage penalty: (60-50)/150 = -6.7%
Speed differential: (70-65)/300 = +1.7%

Total completion chance: 40% + 25% + 20% - 6.7% + 1.7% = 80%
```

### Example 2: Power Run
```
RB (Rush Power: 85, Rush Speed: 60) on power run
OL run blocking average: 70
DL run defense average: 65

Base yards: (70-65)/20 = 0.25 yards
Power bonus: (85-50)/25 = 1.4 yards
Random variance: Â±3 yards

Expected outcome: 0.25 + 1.4 = 1.65 yards + variance
```

### Example 3: QB Sack Avoidance
```
QB (Evasion: 85) under pressure from pass rush
Offensive line failed to provide protection

Base sack chance: 30% (when pressured)
QB evasion modifier: (85-50)/200 = -17.5%
Final sack probability: 30% - 17.5% = 12.5%

Comparison:
- Average QB (Evasion: 50): 30% sack chance
- Elite QB (Evasion: 90): 10% sack chance  
- Poor QB (Evasion: 10): 50% sack chance
```

### Example 4: Field Goal
```
Kicker (Leg Strength: 80, Accuracy: 75, Consistency: 70)
40-yard field goal

Base success rate: 85% (40+ yard kicks)
Leg strength bonus: (80-50)/200 = +15%  
Accuracy bonus: (75-50)/150 = +16.7%
Consistency bonus: (70-50)/200 = +10%

Total success rate: 85% + 15% + 16.7% + 10% = 126.7% â capped at 98%
```
