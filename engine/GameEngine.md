# Game Engine Architecture

## Overview

The Pro Football Clone game engine is a sophisticated football simulation system built in Dart that realistically models American football gameplay. The engine combines strategic AI decision-making, detailed player statistics, and realistic play simulation to create an engaging football management experience.

### Key Design Principles

- **Realism**: Authentic football mechanics based on NFL rules and statistics
- **Transparency**: Detailed simulation breakdowns showing how outcomes are calculated
- **Flexibility**: Modular design allowing for easy expansion and customization
- **Performance**: Efficient simulation capable of running full seasons quickly

## Core Components

The game engine consists of several interconnected components that work together to simulate football games:

### 1. GameEngine (Main Orchestrator)

The `GameEngine` class serves as the central coordinator that manages the entire game simulation process. It maintains the game state and orchestrates the interaction between AI coaches and the play simulator.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Initialize and manage game state
- Coordinate between offensive and defensive teams
- Process play results and update game state
- Handle special game situations (timeouts, penalties, etc.)

### 2. AICoach (Strategic Decision Maker)

The `AICoach` class represents the artificial intelligence that makes strategic decisions for computer-controlled teams. It analyzes the current game situation and selects appropriate plays based on various factors.

**Decision Factors:**
- Current down and distance
- Field position
- Score differential
- Time remaining
- Team strengths and weaknesses
- Coaching staff ratings and tendencies

### 3. PlaySimulator (Physics Engine)

The `PlaySimulator` class is the heart of the gameplay mechanics. It takes play calls from both teams and simulates the actual execution, considering player attributes, matchups, and random factors.

**Simulation Elements:**
- Player attribute calculations
- Matchup analysis (offense vs defense)
- Coaching scheme bonuses
- Random variance for unpredictability
- Special situation handling

### 4. Data Models

#### GameState
Represents the current state of the game at any point in time, including:
- Score (home/away)
- Current possession
- Down and distance
- Field position
- Time remaining
- Quarter information

#### PlayCall
Defines the intended action for a play, including:
- Play type (pass, run, special teams)
- Specific play variant
- Key players involved
- Coaching staff influence

#### PlayResult
Contains the outcome of a simulated play:
- Yards gained/lost
- Time elapsed
- Special outcomes (turnovers, scores)
- Clock management effects
- Player involvement details

#### SimulationBreakdown
Provides detailed logging of simulation calculations for transparency and debugging.

## Detailed Component Analysis

### GameEngine Flow

The GameEngine follows this execution pattern:

1. **Initialization**: Set up initial game state with teams and game parameters
2. **Play Loop**: Continue until game completion
   - Analyze current game state
   - Get play calls from AI coaches
   - Simulate the play
   - Update game state with results
   - Handle special situations
3. **Game Completion**: Final statistics and results

```mermaid

    participant GE as GameEngine
    participant AC as AICoach
    participant PS as PlaySimulator
    participant GS as GameState
    
    GE->>GS: Get current state
    GE->>AC: Request play call (offense)
    AC->>GE: Return offensive play
    GE->>AC: Request play call (defense)
    AC->>GE: Return defensive play
    GE->>PS: Simulate play with calls and state
    PS->>GE: Return play result
    GE->>GS: Update state with result
    
    loop Until Game Complete
        GE->>GS: Check if game over
        Note over GE,GS: Repeat play cycle
    end
```

### AICoach Decision Making

The AICoach uses a sophisticated decision tree that considers multiple factors:

#### Situational Analysis
- **Down and Distance**: Different strategies for 1st & 10 vs 3rd & long
- **Field Position**: Conservative play near own goal, aggressive in red zone
- **Score Differential**: Protect lead vs catch-up scenarios
- **Time Management**: Clock control vs hurry-up offense

### PlaySimulator Mechanics

The PlaySimulator uses a multi-layered approach to determine play outcomes:

#### 1. Base Calculation
- Extract relevant player attributes
- Calculate offensive capability score
- Calculate defensive resistance score

#### 2. Matchup Analysis
- Compare offensive vs defensive ratings
- Apply situational modifiers
- Factor in coaching scheme bonuses

#### 3. Outcome Generation
- Apply randomness within realistic bounds
- Determine yards gained/lost
- Calculate special outcomes (turnovers, big plays)
- Set appropriate time elapsed

#### 4. Result Packaging
- Create detailed PlayResult object
- Generate SimulationBreakdown for transparency
